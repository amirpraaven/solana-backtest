3. **Token Selection**: Focus on high-activity tokens
4. **Performance**: Use batch mode for large-scale tests

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If no results appear:
1. Check API keys are valid
2. Verify database has transaction data
3. Ensure tokens match age criteria (‚â§ 30 days)
4. Check Railway logs for errors

### Common Issues:
- **"No signals found"**: Market conditions may not match
- **"API rate limit"**: Upgrade API plans or reduce batch size
- **"Database timeout"**: Scale up Railway resources
